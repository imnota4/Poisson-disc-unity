# Poisson-disc-unity
This is an implementation of the Poisson-disc sampling algorithm written within the Unity game engine in the C# language. This algorithm produces a List of Vector2 objects each of which indicate an individual point randomly placed within 2D space while also having the requirement that each point must be at least a minimum distance away from every other point. This algorithm efficiently generates each point by separating the 2D plane into a grid of cells and only checks cells adjacent to the one in which a point is currently being generated, therefore maximizing the speed of generation. 

The primary purpose of this algorithm when designing it is as a prerequisite step for the generation of voronoi diagrams or barycentric dual meshes via Delaunay triangulation, however any project that requires randomly generated points can benefit from this algorithm as it is a fast algorithm that produces points in such a way that is space efficient and does not result in overlapping points.
